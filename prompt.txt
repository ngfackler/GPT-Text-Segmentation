You are a linguistic annotator. Your task is to segment the following text into discrete propositions that express predications of a verb (a statement that attributes an action, state, or relation to a subject). In the instructions below, I will refer to these as propositions, but by that, I mean propositions that express predications of a verb. A single sentence can contain multiple propositions of this sort. Separate these propositions using the rules and examples below. 

===========================
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
===========================
- Each line of your output should contain one complete proposition. 
- Each proposition should be a complete, independent statement that can be true or false on its own.
- Maintain sentence order.
- Keep the original wording whenever possible. 
- Do NOT summarize, rephrase, or merge separate facts.
- Do NOT add any additional information.
- Do NOT skip over any information.
- Do NOT add numbers or bullets.
- Always output a full independent proposition with proper punctuation and no conjunctions at the beginning of lines.
- When an idea repeats a subject or phrase that is implied, represent the implied element in square brackets [ ].
- Keep punctuation from the source text when possible.

===========================
LISTS / COORDINATED EXPRESSIONS (and/or)
===========================

DEFINITION

A list or coordinated expression occurs when two or more elements are joined together in the same grammatical role, typically by commas or coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and/or).

RULE: Separate each item in all comma-separated and coordinator-joined (and/or) lists of two or more items.
RULE: Repeat the minimal context so each item becomes a self-contained statement.
RULE: If a list or coordinated expression appears within another structure (e.g., a prepositional phrase, a parenthetical), separate the items.


Examples:

Example where the list occurs in the predicate:
Input:
The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.
Output:

Example where the list occurs in the subject:
Input:
Red, blue, and yellow are primary colors.
Output:
Red is a primary color.

Example where the list occurs in a prepositional phrase:
Input:
Flour is found in bread, cookies, and pretzels.
Output:
Flour is found in bread.

===========================
RESTRICTIVE/NON-RESTRICTIVE MODIFIERS
===========================

DEFINITION

Restrictive modifiers are modifiers which limit or define the meaning of the modified element. Restrictive modifiers are essential to the meaning of the proposition containing the modified element.
Non-restrictive modifiers are modifiers which provide supplemental information to the modified element. The basic meaning of the proposition containing the modified element does not change if the non-restrictive modifier is removed.

While syntactic cues like punctuation and type of relative pronoun can help distinguish between restrictive and non-restrictive modifiers, these cues are not followed consistently in natural English. Therefore, the distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive modifiers is fundamentally semantic, and these syntactic cues should not be relied on exclusively.

===========================

RULE: For parenthetical expressions (i.e., text inside parentheses), parentheticals that are restrictive modifiers should not be separated from the proposition containing the modified element. Parentheticals that are non-restrictive modifiers should be separated from the proposition containing the modified element into an independent proposition. 

Examples:

Examples of restrictive parentheticals:

Input:
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation comes from the sun.
Output:
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation comes from the sun.

Input: 
The animals (dogs) are at the shelter.
Output:
The animals (dogs) are at the shelter.

Input: 
The hormone (estrogen) regulates reproduction.
Output:
The hormone (estrogen) regulates reproduction.

Input:
We can measure reaction time (seconds).
Output:
We can measure reaction time (seconds).

Examples of non-restrictive parentheticals: 

Input:
Red (a primary color) has the longest wavelength.
Output:
Red has the longest wavelength.
[Red is] a primary color.

Input:
Red has the longest wavelength (620-750 nm).
Output:
[The longest wavelength is] 620-750 nm.

Input: 
Animals (e.g., dogs, cats) are at the shelter.
Output:
Animals are at the shelter.
e.g., dogs.
e.g., cats.

===========================

RULE: For relative clauses (i.e., dependent clauses that modify a noun or noun phrase), relative clauses that are restrictive should not be separated from the proposition containing the modified element. Relative clauses that are non-restrictive modifiers should be separated from the proposition containing the modified element. This rule should be applied to both full and reduced relative clauses. Full relative clauses include an explicit relative pronoun (e.g., who, which, that, whose, where, when) and often a finite verb. Reduced relative clauses are shortened forms of relative clauses where the relative pronoun and auxiliary verbs are omitted, or the verb is converted to a participle (-ing or -ed form).

Examples:

Examples of restrictive full relative clauses:

Input:
The cell that divides rapidly is a cancer cell.
Output:
The cell that divides rapidly is a cancer cell. 

Input:
The students who are enrolled in the course passed the exam.
Output:
The students who are enrolled in the course passed the exam.

Input:
The city where I grew up has changed.
Output:
The city where I grew up has changed.

Examples of restrictive reduced relative clauses: 

Input:
The cell dividing rapidly is a cancer cell.
Output:
The cell dividing rapidly is a cancer cell. 

Input:
The students enrolled in the course passed the exam.
Output:
The students enrolled in the course passed the exam.

Input:
The book written by Darwin changed biology.
Output:
The book written by Darwin changed biology.

Examples of non-restrictive full relative clauses:

Input:
Earth, which orbits the Sun, is the third planet.
Output:
Earth is the third planet.
Earth orbits the Sun.

Input:
The brain, which controls the body, is complex.
Output:
The brain is complex.
The brain controls the body.

Input:
Marie Curie, who discovered radium, won two Nobel Prizes.
Output:
Marie Curie won two Nobel Prizes.
Marie Curie discovered radium.

Non-restrictive reduced relative clauses are rare and so no examples are given.

===========================

RULE: For appositives (i.e., a noun or noun phrase that renames or explains another noun or noun phrase next to it), appositives that are restrictive should not be separated from the proposition containing the modified element. Appositives that are non-restrictive modifiers should be separated from the proposition containing the modified element.

Examples:

Examples of restrictive appositives:

Input:
The poet Robert Frost wrote The Road Not Taken.
Output:
The poet Robert Frost wrote The Road Not Taken.

Input:
The novel The Great Gatsby is widely studied in schools.
Output:

===========================
EXEMPLARS (such as, including, like, etc.)
===========================

RULE: Each listed item or phrase introduced by “such as,” “including,” or “like” should be separated as its own proposition.
